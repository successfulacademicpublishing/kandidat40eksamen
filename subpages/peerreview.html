            			<h1>The infinity of peer-review</h1>
            			<p class="opening-text">OK, so this is how it works: You have researched journals <i>and</i> written an excellent paper. <br> You have, with your eyes closed, hit the 'submit' button on the submission platform. <br>Now what?<br>And, what's happening behind the scenes?</p>
        			</div>
					<div class="review-div" alt="picture of a digital network of people">

						<h2>Step by step - the waiting game</h2>
						<p ><strong>Wetting.</strong> The editor or the editorial assistant will check that you have submitted in the correct format and that the article (roughly) fits the journal's aime and scope. This you should have already covered in your preliminary research before you even started writing your article. </p>
						<p class="indent">
						The first thing the editor or editorial assistant will be looking at is your title, abstract and cover letter. If you have invested a litte bit of time preparing and tailoring these components, you already have a head start. </p>
					<p>
						<strong>Peer-review.</strong>
							If the paper is considered a reasonable fit and of an acceptable standard, it will be sent out for review. Most serious journals operate with double blind- review (although there is an increasing call for fully open review processes). It is normal to have at least two reports per article. </p>
					<p class="indent">
						The peer review normally takes time, often several months. Bear in mind that to secure two reviewers, as many as 10 people may have to be asked. Also, remember that your reviewers (and often the editors) are doing the journal work pro-bono, on top of what is already a full-time job. Often, review reports are delayed (or never returned) because of this, again adding to the lenght of the review process. There is much talk of 'reviewer fatigue'. It is increasingly difficult for journals to find willing and suitable reviewers. Journals can't and won't exploit a limited reviewer pools by sending out ten or more invitations at the time, and most journals have no funds to pay for reviews. So, each time the journal invites two or three people, it has to wait for an answer which may take days or weeks, even.</p>
					<p class="indent">
					When the required number of review repoers have been receieved, the paper and the reports often have to wait in line for the editor's attention. Here, practice varies greatly. Some journals will simply return the review reports with their decision of 'reject', 'revise'  or 'accpet', other editors will summarise the reports and give constructive pointers for the way forward for the author, regardless of the decision. Naturally, the latter procedure takes longer than the former, but it is (nearly) always worth the wait.</p>
					
					<p> <strong>Revision.</strong> As good as all papers will need at least one round of serious revision. As a young scholar, you should be deeply sceptical of any journal that offers 'quick reviews' or accepts papers with a minimum of (if any)revisions. These warning signs have been covered under the <a href="../subpages/getpublished.html#pirates">'Look out for pirates'</a> section. </p>
					</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="end-box">
							<div class="left-text">
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Wait.</strong> Approximately six weeks after submission it is legitimate to ask for an update if you have heard nothing.</li>
									<li><strong >Review.</strong> Time in review varies greatly. Three months is not uncommon.</li>
							
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="right-text">
					<ul>
							<li> <strong>Revise.</strong> Immediate accept is extremely rare. Make sure to explain how you have addressed the reviewers' concern and, if you have ignored their point(s), why.</li>
							<li> <strong>Wait.</strong> Time from submission to evental publication is often as long as 18 months, or more.</li>
							
						</ul>
					</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="follow-on-text-sub">
						<p><strong>Resubmit.</strong> Do pay close attention to your reviewer reports and any pointers from the editor. When you resubmit after a few months, it is a good idea to include a memo outlining how you've met the points of requested revisions, and if you have decided to ignore any, why.</p>
						<p><strong>Wait.</strong> The good news is that the second round normally is shorter. Many journals will be prepared to move ahead towards a straight-forward accept or reject at this point, or perhaps ask for some minor revisions. Some journals, especially the top ranked journals, may well wish to send the article out for review again. This is normal, and not necessarily a bad sign. Often, even, the contrary. You've successfully jumped another hurdle.</p>
						<p class="indent"> A second round of external review is also usually quicker than the first. Commonly, it is the same reviewers from the first round who will be asked again. This time they are alreday committed and prepared and will turn their reports round faster. The same goes for the editor. Still, a lot can happen, people -because that's what they are, your reviewers and editors- cntrary to common belief among young scholars. They get sick or have changed priorities etc. just like everyone else. The wait can therefoee still be significant. Hang in there.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Final decision.</strong> At last a decison. If it was a reject, the ball starts all over again with first researching new journals, and then rewrite to tailor that journal. And, don't forget to revise your cover letter. Nothing quite as charming as to receive a submission addressed to your competitor. Noone, likes being second choice...</p>
						<p class="indent">If your paper has been  accepted, another waiting game now starts: production. The production process involves all the processes needed to make a word file in to the printed paper and online version. Copy edting, type setting, proof checking, html-coding, tagging, referencing and so on. From an article is sent in to production and until it can be displayed on the journal's website, it normally takes around four months. You should expect at least one proof from the journal's publisher in this process. This will be your last opportunity to make any final -minor- changes to your manuscrtipt.</p>
						<p class="indent">
						But, the wait may not be over yet. The article may well appear online at the publisher's website. For all intents and purposes this is what counts as 'published', but f√≠f your journal is still producing physical paper copies, it might still be a lenghty wait to see your article appear in print. Sometimes up to a year. The most significant consequence of this wait, is that it will take time before there is an issue and volume number ready for citation purposes, but with online publications now being the dominant route, this is a relatively minor problem.
