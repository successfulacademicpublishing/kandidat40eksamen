						<h1>Let's get started</h1>
							<p class="follow-on-text"><strong>Where to start.</strong> Successful scolarly publication is largely about careful preparations. First of all, do not assume it is sufficient to take a chapter out of your PhD thesis and simply submit. A scolarly article is a very different format, so make sure you fmiliarize yourself thoroughly with this format. Below, you will find a list of some really excellent books that will help you improve writining and tailoring academic articles.</p>
						<p class="indent">If you have written a great article on engeneering of skyscrapers, it  is no good if you submit it to a journal that focuses on tunnel engineering. Selecting your outlet is important from the onset, but it can be hard to know which journal you should go for. Under 'getting published' you will find some tips to help you decide where to (hopefully) publish.</p>
						<p><Strong>What can you expect.</Strong> Academic journals comes in many forms and format, style, practices and and process varies grately across -and within- disciplines. This site has social science as it starting point, but seeks to cover the commonalities for scolarly journal publications.</p>
						<p class="indent">
						The peer review process is the back-bone of scolarly publishing. It is by no means a perfect process, but it is the best we as a scholarly community have. The peer review process varies from fully blinded to fully open. It can be hard for a nw scholar to be sure the process he/she will receive is of sufficient standard. On this site we will give some pointers for what you might expect and some warning signs you should be looking out for to avoid wasting you hard efforts by falling victim to the pirate-journals and publishers out there.
						</p>
						<h2>First thing first</h2>
						<p>Define clearly what it is you want to say. This will also help you shape your research question. Next, decide who it is you think should be listening to you. Then, you need to find out <i>where</i> your listerners are. </p> 
						
						<p><strong>Which journal should you aim for?</strong> Before you submit to your favorite journal, you should consider if it really is the best outlet for your article, and for you. Researching the journal propely to identify aims and scope is a good start, but as a junior scholar with few, if any, publications, starting with the top-end journals might be a bit intimidating, and potentially depressing. Rejection rates are really high.	
						</p>
						<p>Talk to your senior colleages about where it might be good to publish. Look the journals up online, research their aims and scope. Read the submission guidelines. Is the journal ranked? Has it got a high impact factor? The higher the impact factor, the higher the rejection rate. Many high-end journals have rejection rates of more than 70%. Few journals will advertise their rejection rates, but the higher the ranking and impact, the harder it is to get in. This is, of course, not to say you shouldn't be submitting to the high-end journals. Many of these are keen to hear from young and fresh voices. However, they will not compromise on quality, so it does mean extra hard work on your part to make sure you hit the bull's eye in your preparations.</p>
						<p class="indent"><strong>Tailor your article</strong> Once you have selected the best outlet for your article, study the aims and scope and submission guidelines. Tailor your article to in the best possible way meet this journal's core field of interest. This will probably only entail relatively minor tweaks to your article, but pay particular attention to the title and abstract in this process.</p>

						<p><strong>To avoid stumbling at the outset,</strong> it is important to stop before submission to make sure you are submitting where and to whom you actually intend to. <i>'Pirate-', or 'predatory' publishing </i> is a phenonomen that has been around for a while, but is becoming increasingly wide-spread and hard to detect. Pirate journals (and indeed pirate publishers) make money from charging authors for publication while offering nothing in return. The journals are not ranked, do not offer a genuine peer-review and publications here will e 'null-and-void' for you on your CV and your career. </p>
						<p class="indent">Author Processing Charges (APF) is not uncommon in certain disciplines (e.g. medicine) and in Open Access publications. So, while it APF is not a definite red flag, any request for you as an author to pay should make you stop and check the reputation of the journal. Here are some key issues you should check, and suggestions to what you should do to make sure you err on the right side:</p>
					
								
									
						</div>
						<div class="follow-on-text-float-indent">
							<p><strong>Unsolicited contact?</strong> Did the journal or publisher send you an unsolicited message to say they found your work interesting and would like to publish you? Unless you actually <i>know</i> the person who approached you, you can be quite sure the sender does not have your best interests at heart. Delete the message, and do your own research to find a suitable outlet. </p>
									
									<p><strong>Familiar journal?</strong> Before you submit, make sure you have the right journal. Predatory journals often take on very similar names to their real counter-part. Check if the journal has a legitimate publisher. If it is a web-only journal and does not have a publisher, it will genreally belong to a society. Check out the society. You should also look at the editorial board. Are there any familiar names? Look up, and try to contact one or two of the memebers and ask them abou the journal. For pirate journals editorial boards are usually entirely fictional.</p>
									
									<p>
									<strong>   Is there an Author Processing Charge?</strong> If so, how high is it? A reputable journal will charge reasonable fees. Is it an Open Access journal? Does the journal have any fee waivers for young and/or global south authors? In case, chances are higher it is legitimate.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Look at a recent issue</strong> of the publication you're considering. Predatory journls are often extremley broad in scope, publishing on anything from hoovers to international relations at the same time. These days broad, legitimate, Open Acces jurnals such as <i>Plos+</i> are becoming more common and mudding the water for a poor resarcher trying to navigate around pirates. The key clue here should be to look at the <i>publisher</i>. Running Open Access journals are expensive, if it is legitimate the publisher is likely to be well known and well reputed.

						<p>There are a few lists around that can help you navigate troubled water. The <a href="https://beallslist.net/" target="_blank">'Beall' list </a>was originally compiled by a pationate academic who checked credentials of many journals. For various reasons the list was discontinued in 2017 (see, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beall%27s_List" target="_blank">this Wikipedia explanation</a>), but someone has picked up the ball and started updating the list again. However, it is unclear who is now running this list, so it should be used with caution.</p>
						<p class="indent">The <a href="https://predatoryjournals.com/journals/" target="_blank">Predatory journals</a>
						is also worth checking out, but as with Beall's list, it is unclear who are running and updating these lists, so they should be used with caution. There is no guarantee the journal is not predatory just because it is not on these listsm and vice-versa. Appearence on these lists are merely indicators.</p>

However,suepected predatory journals have been detected also on these lists, so there really is no way around doing your own research.
